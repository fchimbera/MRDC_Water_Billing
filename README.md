# MRDC_Water_Billing
Project Idea
The aim is to create a web application for the Mutasa Rural District Council to collect water meter readings, automate the calculation of water bills, and produce water bills for residents. The app will feature an admin panel, a meter reader's panel, and a user panel. The admin panel will enable administrators to set rates and manage water bills. The meter reader's panel will allow meter readers to input meter readings. The user panel will enable residents to view their bills and payment history.

Admin Panel
